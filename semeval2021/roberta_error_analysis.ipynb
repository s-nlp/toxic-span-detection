    "The goal of this notebook is to make some qualitative conclusion about the nature of errors our model makes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "- The vocabulary of false negatives (527 unique tokens) is more various than that of false positives (275 unique tokens), while their volume is comparable (860 vs 813 tokens). It may indicate that the model is \"cautious\" and prefers to highlight sure options, while human annotators are more creative in their analysis. \n",
    "- The most frequent false positive words characterize incompetence or lack of mental capacities: \"stipid\", \"idiot\", \"ignorant\", \"moron\", \"dumb\", etc. Other frequent false positives are derogatory (\"pathetic\", \"ridiculous\", \"ass\", \"garbage\", \"loser\", etc.), denounce particular misdeeds (\"liar\", \"troll\", \"racist\", \"hypocrite\", etc.), or express general negativity (\"damn\", \"fuck\", etc.). It's not obvious why human annotators label them as toxic in some cases, and as non-toxic in other cases. We suspect that inter-annotator agreement on such words is low. \n",
    "- The most frequent false negative words are mostly function words: \"and\", \"the\", \"are\", \"a\", \"you\" etc. It happens because annotators sometimes label the whole text or a large chunk of it as toxic. The more meaningful false negatives belong to the same classes as the false positives (\"ignorant\", \"racist\", \"loser\", etc.). \n"
